# AI-Based Policy Consulting Service Optimization

This project focuses on the optimization of **policy consulting services** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically integrating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology. The main goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of policy advice through advanced AI technologies.

## 📘 Project Overview

Since the introduction of ChatGPT in 2022, AI Large Language Models have started to impact various industries, peaking in early 2025 with the launch of the **DeepSeek-R1 model**. The **policy consulting** field, which studies government processes, is also profoundly affected by these new technologies. This paper explores these impacts using **comparative research methods** and predicts future trends in the field.

Experiments were conducted using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology, offering practical methods for future practitioners and people involved in policy consulting, promoting rapid development of the field in the AI-driven era.
