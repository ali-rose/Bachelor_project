Wav2Lip Acceleration Project (TensorRT Optimization)
This repository documents my work on implementing and optimizing the Wav2Lip deep learning model.

The project was executed in two distinct phases:

1. Architectural Implementation (From Scratch)
Objective: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Wav2Lip architecture, which ensures highly realistic lip synchronization in synthesized video.

Key Work: Implementing the full model structure from the ground up, with a focus on core components such as the Visual Quality Discriminator and the unique Lip Sync Loss function. This phase emphasized clarity in data flow and component integration.

2. High-Performance Optimization with TensorRT
Objective: To significantly reduce inference latency and prepare the model for high-throughput deployment.

Key Work: Conversion of the fully implemented Wav2Lip model into an NVIDIA TensorRT (TRT) engine. This involved model graph optimization and quantization techniques to leverage GPU acceleration, resulting in substantial speed-up compared to standard framework inference.

This project showcases expertise in both neural network architecture implementation and deployment-level performance optimization.
